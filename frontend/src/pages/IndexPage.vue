          VESBI is a web application developed as part of a Master's thesis at the University of TÃ¼bingen in
          collaboration with the Geophysics group (Prof. Dr. Reinhard Drews) and Machine Learning in Science (Prof. Dr.
          Jakob Macke).
          This application is designed to provide a probabilistic approach for
          analysis of geoelectric measurement data, by inverting <strong>Vertical Electrical Sounding (VES)</strong>
          with <strong>Simulation-based Inference (SBI)</strong>. VESBI offers a user friendly platform for
          geophysicists and
          researchers to
          invert their VES data.

          <strong>Key Features:</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>Data Upload: Upload geoelectric measurement data from Vertical Electrical
              Sounding with a Schlumberger survey configuration in .csv, .xls or .xlsx format.
            </li>
            <li>Probabilistic Inversion: We provide two pretrained posterior networks. The models were trained on
              simulations of different prior distributions to define the soil resistivity profile.
              The first network uses Legendre Polynomials of degree 5 and the second network uses a spatially
              regularized
              step prior to represent the resistivity depth profile.
            </li>
            <li>
              Soon: Data Download including the trained posterior networks for further custom analysis.
            </li>
